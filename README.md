## Overview

Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used to automate tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software. This repository provides all the required resources to set up Jenkins in a containerized environment using **Docker Compose**.

With Jenkins, you can easily integrate continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) into your development workflow.

---

## Features

- **Docker Compose-based setup**: Simplifies Jenkins installation with easy-to-use configuration.
- **Persistent storage**: All Jenkins configurations and data are stored in Docker volumes, ensuring data persistence.
- **Simple setup**: Quickly run Jenkins with minimal effort.
- **Scalable**: Easily scale Jenkins to multiple nodes for parallel builds.
- **Customizable**: Add Jenkins plugins and customize Jenkins pipelines as needed.

---

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:abbal-ilyas/Jenkins.git
   cd Jenkins
   ```

2. **Build and start Jenkins with Docker Compose**:

   Use the following command to bring up Jenkins and its dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start Jenkins in detached mode and create all necessary volumes to persist data.

3. **Access Jenkins**:

   Once the Jenkins container is up and running, you can access Jenkins through your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   **Note**: If you're using a remote server, replace `localhost` with the server's IP or domain.

4. **Unlock Jenkins**:

   On your first visit to Jenkins, you'll need to unlock Jenkins using an administrator password:

   1. Run the following command to get the initial Jenkins password:

      ```bash
      docker logs jenkins
      ```

   2. Copy the password from the output and paste it into the **Administrator password** field in your browser.

## Usage

### Installing Plugins

Once Jenkins is up and running, you can install the plugins you need directly from the **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Plugins** section.

For common use cases, you may want to install the following plugins:
- **Git Plugin**: For interacting with Git repositories.
- **Pipeline Plugin**: For creating Jenkins pipelines.
- **SSH Agent Plugin**: For connecting to remote servers.
- **Blue Ocean Plugin**: For a more modern UI and improved pipeline visualizations.

### Creating a Jenkins Pipeline

1. From the Jenkins dashboard, click **New Item**.
2. Choose **Pipeline** and provide a name for your job.
3. In the **Pipeline** section, you can configure your pipeline using **Jenkinsfile** or directly from the UI.
4. For basic examples, refer to [Jenkins Pipeline Examples](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/examples/).

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Jenkins Not Starting

- **Check Docker Logs**: Run `docker-compose logs` or `docker logs <container-name>` to inspect logs.
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports `8080` and `50000` are available and not used by other services.
- **Volume Issues**: If there are issues with Docker volumes, remove them using `docker volume prune` (be cautious as this will remove unused volumes).

### Issue 2: Can't Access Jenkins

- **Firewall Settings**: If you're running Jenkins on a remote server, ensure that the necessary ports (8080 and 50000) are open in the firewall.
- **Container Health**: Check if the container is running with `docker ps` and verify that it is healthy.
